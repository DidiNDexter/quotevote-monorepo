# Welcome to Quote.Vote

Quote.Vote is a text-first civic engagement platform designed for thoughtful public dialogue. It’s a space where people can post, vote, and discuss written content — focusing on ideas instead of algorithms or ads.

### Core Principles

- **Text-First:** Quote.Vote emphasizes words over visuals. Every conversation starts from written ideas, not photos or memes.
- **Public-by-Default:** All posts and discussions are open and visible to everyone. This promotes transparency and shared understanding.
- **Respectful Participation:** Engage with curiosity and empathy. Listen, read carefully, and respond thoughtfully.
- **Reflection Over Reaction:** Take a moment to understand before responding. The platform encourages meaningful dialogue instead of quick takes.

 **Tip:** Quote.Vote is designed for reflection, not argument. The more you engage with respect and clarity, the better the discussions become.
